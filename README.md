# Chaining-Selectors
CSS Selectors Practice: Chaining Classes
Project Overview
This project is designed to help you practice and understand how to chain multiple CSS class selectors to apply unique styles to elements with shared and individual class names. The exercise also provides an opportunity to review the use of images in HTML.

You will work on two images, each having two class names, where one class is shared between them. The objective is to chain the selectors effectively so that each image has distinct styles applied based on its unique combination of class names.

Features
CSS Chaining: Practice applying styles using chained class selectors for elements with shared and unique classes.
Responsive Dimensions: Maintain aspect ratios and proportions dynamically for one element while hardcoding specific dimensions for another.
HTML Images Review: Reinforce the basics of adding and styling images in HTML.
Styling Objectives
Image with Classes avatar and proportioned:

Width: 300px
Height: Adjust dynamically to retain original square proportions (no hardcoding height).
Image with Classes avatar and distorted:

Width: 200px
Height: 400px (twice the width, hardcoded).
